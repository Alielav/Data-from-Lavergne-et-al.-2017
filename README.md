# Purpose

Meteorological data, d18Oprecip outputs from LMDZ-NCEP20 and MUGCM models and tree-ring d18O data used in Lavergne et al. (2017) for Argentina and Québec.

The daily meteorological data used for Québec were retrieved from the webpage of the Natural Resources Canada products (Natural Resources Canada, http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/4), while those for Argentina were extracted from the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (ESRL-NOAA) webpage (ESRL-NOAA, 20th Century Reanalysis V2c, https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/ gridded/data.20thC_ReanV2c.html). 

The daily d18Op data from the MUGCM model were extracted via the SWING project webpage (SWING project, http://paos.colorado.edu/~dcn/SWING/database.php), while those from LMDZ-NCEP20 were given by Camille Risi, co-author of the paper.

The code of the MAIDEN model can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5446435.v1 (Gennaretti et al., 2017).
